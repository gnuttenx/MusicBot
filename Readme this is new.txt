Developed from the original:review version by Just-Some-Bots. 
Codes taken from different users and put together.

Now playing [np] added a little visual bar for progress.

New commands:
playnow: Immediately plays the requested song, skipping whatever is currently playing
promote: Promotes last song in queue to front
promote [position]: Promotes song at position to front
repeat: Cycles between repeat all, repeat single, or repeat none
next: The same as skip
remove: Removes 1st song in queue
remove [position]: Removes song at position
stop: The same as pause

Looking into: Autosummon to voicechannel when someone writes play-command if not in any channel yet.
